Automating the creation of custom [open graph (OG) images](https://ogp.me/) opens up interesting business use cases from personalized conference tickets to shareable user profiles and more. Fundamentally automated OG images unlock personalized information sharing at scale. You can manually create 10 images, maybe a couple hundred images, but if you have thousands or millions of images all needing dynamic content then this is the way to go.

Probably one of the most well known examples of this is the generated OG images for GitHub repositories. GitHub generates a social image with some basic information about the repository; stars, contributors, etc. The information is useful and it helps users make a decision about whether they want to click that link in their social media stream or not.

  In this blog post I am going to show how to do this using Netlify Edge
  Functions but Vercel also has a [great solution for generated OG images
  too](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation).

## Getting setup

1. Use an existing project or initialize a fresh repository of whatever frontend framework you prefer (this demo uses Astro but it will work with NextJS, Remix, SvelteKit and others).
2. Make sure you have a current version of the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/) by running `npm install netlify-cli -g`.
3. Create a blank edge function at `/netlify/edge-functions/og-image.ts` file. This will be where all of the magic happens!
4. Create a `netlify.toml` file in the root of your project with the following code:

```toml title="netlify.toml"
[[edge_functions]]
function = "og-image"
path = "/api/og-image"
```

5. Run `netlify dev` to start up your project using the Netlify development server which will let us test and preview the edge function. The first time you do this you should some prompts about configuring your code editor for Edge Functions.

## Making a basic image

Open up your `og-image.ts` edge function and paste in the following code:

```tsx title="og-image.ts"
//@ts-nocheck: Typescript not recognizing as JSX due to edge function
import React from 'https://esm.sh/react@18.2.0'
import { ImageResponse } from 'https://deno.land/x/og_edge/mod.ts'

export default async function handler(req: Request) {
  return new ImageResponse(
    (
      <div
        style={{
          width: '100%',
          height: '100%',
          display: 'flex',
          alignItems: 'center',
          justifyContent: 'center',
          fontSize: 128,
          background: 'lavender',
        }}
      >
        Hello world!
      </div>
    ),
  )
}
```

Now goto `localhost:4321/api/og-image` and check our the beautiful hello world! Nothing special happening here, yet.

## Getting dynamic

The magic of automated open graph images is that they can be generated at run time based on whatever query parameters you provide. User name, blog post title, address, product rating, price, etc. You can get as creative as you want here.

We pass this information to our image generation API using [URL search params](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams). It could look a little like this: `https://www.my-site.com/api/og-image?title=Hello%20World`. The important bits are the parts that come after the `?` mark.

Our edge function can then decode these search params and we can use them in our code as variables.

Here is a simple example building on what we had before:

```tsx title="og-image.ts" {6-7, 22}
//@ts-nocheck: Typescript not recognizing as JSX due to edge function
import React from 'https://esm.sh/react@18.2.0'
import { ImageResponse } from 'https://deno.land/x/og_edge/mod.ts'

export default async function handler(req: Request) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(req.url)
  const title = searchParams.get('title')

  return new ImageResponse(
    (
      <div
        style={{
          width: '100%',
          height: '100%',
          display: 'flex',
          alignItems: 'center',
          justifyContent: 'center',
          fontSize: 128,
          background: 'lavender',
        }}
      >
        {title}
      </div>
    ),
  )
}
```
