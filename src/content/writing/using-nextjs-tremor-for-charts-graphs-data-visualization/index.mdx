import BarChart from '~/components/nextjs-tremor-post/BarChart.tsx'

Charts, graphs, and data visualizations are an important tool when presenting data or trying to explain a complex topic more clearly. They are widely used in websites, apps, and other digital media. Just think back to the last major election and I guarantee it was brimming with charts and graphs!

Creating these charts is not always easy with lots of potential gotcha moments. I have tried a lot of charting and data visualization libraries and found that [Tremor](https://www.tremor.so/) strikes the right balance between configurability, good design, and happy defaults.

With Tremor it is easier to land in the pit of success.

That isn't to say it is perfect, by being opinionated about design Tremor is less configurable than some other charting libraries. Tremor also uses Tailwind for styling which is a bonus for some and a dealbreaker for others.

## Getting setup

If you don't already have a Next.js project with Tailwind installed and configured then you can follow their [getting started guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation), which will preconfigure Next.js and Tailwind for you.

If you have a greenfield project you can use `npx @tremor/cli@latest init` to quickly install Tremor. If you have an existing project you should follow their [installation instructions](https://www.tremor.so/docs/getting-started/installation) so you don't overwrite your existing `tailwind.config.ts` file.

## Our first chart

My son is in grade 3 recently had to make a bar chart of his classmates favourite kinds of weather. So let's start there!

Data for Tremor charts has index values which are the values used as labels on the axis. It also has what are called categories which are the values actually plotted on the graph.

In this example our index values will be the different types of weather and our single category will be the number of classmates.

```ts
const data = [
  {
    Weather: 'Sunny',
    Classmates: 10,
  },
  {
    Weather: 'Snowy',
    Classmates: 5,
  },
  {
    Weather: 'Cloudy',
    Classmates: 4,
  },
  {
    Weather: 'Rainy',
    Classmates: 2,
  },
  {
    Weather: 'Foggy',
    Classmates: 1,
  },
]
```
