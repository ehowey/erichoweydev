Here is the TLDR. I think most of the time and for most situations, you should use a "starter" when beginning a new Gatsby project. In my opinion Gatsby themes are best suited for two main use cases; large enterprise size projects or a high flow design/development agency.

I say this as someone who has invested a tremendous amount of time and energy into using and learning about [Gatsby themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/themes/). I even helped write some of the Gatsby docs way-back-when about [composing multiple themes](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/tutorial/using-multiple-themes-together) together. The core concept behind Gatsby themes is solid and it remains a powerful framework feature, however my experience has been that themes eventually become a burden for small-medium sized projects.

## What are Gatsby themes?

Gatsby themes are a way to abstract and encapsulate specific portions of a website so that it can be maintained and updated independently from the deployed project. Imagine building blocks that are assembled together to form a complete website. I also believe that themes can be largely divided into four subtypes; core themes, layout themes, data themes, and presentational themes. You can read more about this idea in a [blog post I wrote for Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2020-05-14-introducing-gatsby-theme-catalyst/) on the topic of themes.

## Pros and Cons

The pros and cons of Gatsby themes aren't distinct but related - one person's pro is another person's con. You need to see themes through the lens of your use case to understand how using a theme might be a benefit or a hindrance.

This story starts and ends with abstraction. Gatsby themes allows you to neatly cut your website up into blocks and compose them together as you see fit. The themes are then available on either a private or public repository and used as a depedency like anything else. Components, design systems, and data models all neatly tucked into seperate packages. When I was using themes I often had 3, 4 or 5 different themes linked together. Configuration was as simple as changing a few theme options inside `gatsby-config.js`.

One immediate plus of this approach is speed. Even faster than a starter. All of the configuration options that need to be tweaked are right in front of you. This meant that I could immediately start focusing time on writing code that was unique to a particular project and did not have to revisit setting up something like a layout component.

Another plus is maintainability; each theme is walled off from the main website and can be worked on independently without affectng the deployed project. A design team can focus on the design system and component library, while the backend team can focus on the data model and sourcing. No changes are applied to the production website until its packages are updated.

Without a doubt the biggest pro of Gatsby themes is the ability to encapsulate and abstract portions of a Gatsby site. Imagine building blocks clicking together to create the final website. Gatsby themes can be anything from a set of visual components, to a 'core' theme that handles setting up the GraphQL queries, packages, and overall site structure. A theme can be large or small, however finding the balance between too large and too small can be a bit tricky,

The second pro of Gatsby themes is the concept of [component shadowing](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/plugins-and-themes/shadowing/) which allows you to replace components and files from the theme in the final Gatsby website. This is a really powerful model, with a catch. More on that catch in a moment.

The third pro of Gatsby themes is easy upgrades and maintenance. The themes can be published to either a public or private NPM repository and updates are as simple as a version change. The design team can focus on a component library, the frontend team can pull all those changes into the site with just a simple version update.

The last pro of Gatsby themes is simplicity. Gatsby themes can take a set of options similar to a plugin which can allow you to provide an entire site, wrapped up in a bow, that can just be installed like a plugin, accept a predefined set of options and boom you are off and running.

As you can see there are a lot of pros. And I believe Gatsby themes remain an important part of the Gatsby ecosystem. They just aren't quite done.

## Cons

In many ways the cons of Gatsby themes mirror the pros. And here is where context matters.
