Did you know that 75% of the world does not speak any English?? I didn't before I started writing this article. Holy cheese batman, internationalizing your content and your sales channels is HUGELY important if you want to reach a global audience.

There are a plethora or tools and platforms to localize your content; I can't begin to cover them all but one combination that has worked well for me is using NextJs and Sanity together. NextJs handles localized routing and IP-based geolocation while Sanity organizes your content and lets you query the content in a logical way with their GROQ query language.
