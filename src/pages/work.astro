    <p>
      Like many good things in life, my work begins with human connection and
      relationship. Iâ€™m a web developer and mental health therapist after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy taking the time to get things right and am a big believer that
      slow is smooth and smooth is fast. I typically just work on a few
      contracts per year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each project I work on goes through a full design and development cycle
      all the way from setting initial business goals to launching a finished
      website live on the internet. Along the way we will meet regularly and you
      also have full access to a live staging website to follow progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also do some contract frontend development work for larger companies
      working as part of an existing engineering team. I have experience with
      marketing, writing, internationalization, brand development, and data
      visualization. From a technical perspective I am most comfortable in
      React-based codebases and have solid HTML and CSS fundamentals.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a Master of Social Work (MSW) degree from the University of
      Victoria and am a Registered Social Worker in the province of Alberta.
