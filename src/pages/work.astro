      <p>
        Like many good things in life, my work begins with human connection and
        relationship. Iâ€™m a web developer and mental health therapist after all.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy taking the time to get things right and am a big believer that
        slow is smooth and smooth is fast. I typically just work on a few
        contracts per year.
