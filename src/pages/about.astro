      Heyo! My name is Eric Howey (he/him) and among other things I am a web
      developer and mental health therapist. I enjoy mountain biking, skiing,
      and being outside. I've seen a polar bear in real life and dropped off a
      30 foot waterfall in a kayak (on purpose). I've also been told that I have
      bad hair and a cute dog.

    <p>But you aren't here for old-time adventure stories. You're here for websites.</p>
    <p>
      I have been building websites in one form or another since before I could grow facial hair. I enjoy the juxtaposition between creating websites and my job as a mental health therapist. Fixing a line of code is reassuringly certain when contrasted with the ambiguity of human experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      I derive a lot of joy from problem solving and learning as I design and
      code. Seeing something I have made live on the internet still gives me a
      little rush!
