I spent a fair amount of time in March and April digging into RedwoodJS after having toyed around with it a small amount about a year ago when it was earlier in its development process. As of this writing it has not yet reached v1 but a lot has happened in a year and I wanted to chart some of my reflections for future me.

You might find this useful if you are considering adopting Redwood for a project and wanted some perspective.

You should know that I _did not_ take an app into production with Redwood but did complete both tutorials, hacked around integrating Supabase and Redwood, integrated Theme-UI and Chakra-UI, built out a few layouts, and started green fielding an idea for an app. I stopped working on Redwood only because I got hired onto a contract that took my attention (and time).

You should also know that my frame of reference for Redwood is Gatsby - Gatsby/React is where I have done most of my professional work the last 2-3 years and is the lens through which I am viewing Redwood.

## Comparing Gatsby, NextJS and Redwood

All three of these meta-frameworks sit on top of React and at their core share this key similarity. It feels however like they get progressively more opinionated and structured about how you should write and deploy React.

NextJS - very few opinions. Gatsby - some opinions. Redwood - many opinions.

At the end of the day Gatsby and Redwood are both meta-frameworks on top of React. Which means that you can use a lot of the packages/tech you are already familiar with and high level thinking skills transfer pretty well.

Additionally both Redwood and Gatsby rely on GraphQL for data fetching in your frontend.
